# Informatics in Biochemistry Course

Dear all, 

this is the repository that we will use during our course. 

You can download it by clicking on the green "_CODE_" button and choosing "Download ZIP".

Make sure to not change the folder structure of the repository or else some image links might get broken and not work anymore.
