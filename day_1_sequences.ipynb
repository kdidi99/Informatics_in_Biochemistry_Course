    "### Tuples\r\n",
    "Tuples are very similar to lists, with the only difference that we can't change them after their creation - they are **immutable**, while lists are **mutable** (we will see examples for that soon). Under the hood his makes data storage of tuples more efficient and code involving tuples is a little faster. It is therefore considered good practice to always consider whether you really need a list or could also use a tuple, but we will not care for this for now, as those differences only matter for very large data frames or complex programs.\r\n",
