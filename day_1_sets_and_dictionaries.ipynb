In theory, you can use immutable data types like `tuples`, `integers`, or `floats` for your dictionary keys but most often you use a `string`.\n",

For example, if you took multiple measurements in an experiment you could store the individual values as lists and assign them to dictionary keys like \"measurement 1\", \"measurement 2\", ...
